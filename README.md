# Bourgeoisie

Bourgeoisie is a simple template for setting up a modern react development
with react. It is based in part on the faboulous [este](https://github.com/este/este)
by Daniel Steigerwald. Largelly this template is an opinionated view of how
to structure a project, much like those Bourgeoisie that Marx decried, it 
presentes one source of truth, and is haughty and condescening about it. That
being sent, if it fits your persuasions, join the nobility and use the project!
