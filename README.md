# Studiosfontainebleau

Studiosfontainebleau is a simple site to allow for students to rent appartments
in Fontainbleau paris. The site itself is based off of the 
[bourgeoisie](https://github.com/the1codemaster/bourgeoisie) which is/was still in
its infancy at the time of this development. 

A few things to note about the sourcecode, all (and I mean all) of the styles are 
created using CSS in JS, specificly they all derive from the Box component. There 
are no lower level react components in any any of the source except for Box. The 
file structure is based on Atomic Design principles, you can find out more in
[Brad Frost's excellent post](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). 
Or read more on it once the docs are finished for 
[bourgeoisie](https://github.com/the1codemaster/bourgeoisie).
