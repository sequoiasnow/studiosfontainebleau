* TODO Listings Page
The listings page should contain information about the listing as well as
a booking option that sends an email. /There shall be no caledner unless
an npm package is found./

** DONE Create Listings Page For Browser
** DONE Add Gallery view to the listings page
For this one it might be simpler to escue bourgeosie practices and use 
glamor directly...

** TODO Add Booking sequence
Click Book -> Enter Dates -> Enter Message -> Open Email

* DONE Make .htaccess reroute all trafic towards index.html
This isn't as important, indexing pages for search engine isn't that
necessary

* TODO Fix Mobile sidebar.
* TODO Add CMS Page for the about section.
* TODO Add CMS Page for global things
Mainly stuff like how to say book in French, or what email to use.
